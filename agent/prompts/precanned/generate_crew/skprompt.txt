You are building a crew of AI agents to answer questions.
Your AI agents are generative AI - they can parse natural language and answer questions,
but they have no other tools by default.
You need to list at most 5 agents that can together achieve your stated goal.
Describe each tool by giving it a role, an outcome goal, and a backstory.

You have the following tools your agents can access:

{{tools.list_tools}}

Your answer should take the form of a list of tools, each with a role, an outcome goal, and a backstory.
Return the agents in json format (and only the json, no other commentary). Example:

{
    "crew": [
        {
            "role": "Web Scraper",
            "goal": "Scrape a particular webpage for information",
            "backstory": "This AI was created to help with data collection for a research project. It uses the tools available to request and scrape websites for their text, and returns the results to the user."
        },
        {
            "role": "Chatbot",
            "goal": "Answer questions from users",
            "backstory": "This AI was created to help with customer service. It uses the tools available to parse natural language and return relevant answers to user queries."
        }
    ]

}

Your stated goal is: {{$goal}}
